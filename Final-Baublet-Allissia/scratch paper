				<h3>Random Projects</h3>

				<p> The link below will take you my github page that shows all the projects I did
					at the TechPoint Bootcamp 2017. This camp taught me how to use the React framework with somewhat
					advanced JavaScript to create various pages.

				<p> The link above will take you to the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra's new website redesigned by
					<i>Adam Hughes, Alex Flinchum, Emily Wattimena, Deepthi Devireddy, Jesica Courtney</i> and myself. We are part
					of an Indiana University organization called ServeIT and our mission is to provide nonprofit organizations
					with new/updated technology that they cannot afford or need assistance with. BSO came to ServeIT looking for
					a redesigned website that was modern and that expressed their mission and values.

					<h4>Ucommon</h4></a>

				<p>At the link above, you will find a team project done in Info-I 300 based on Human Interaction with an Interface.
					The assignment was to create a mockup of an application made for students. My team and I decided to make
					a app that provides access an online community forum, the ability to apply for jobs and internships,
					and a virtual network of connections to their peers and professionals.
					InVision provides the mockup with some functionality for our conceptual idea.

					<h4>OSXtern</h4></a>

				<p>This project was one completed as a techscreen for Xtern 2018. I was given a prompt for an application
					called OSXtern that kept the user connected to Indianapolis and TechPoint. After a few days of hard work
					and feedback, this is the final result (the link above). I created the mockup using the beta version of
					Adobe XD, which is a very useful tool as a starting designer.

				<h3> Digital Imagery </h3>
				<h4> Hybrid Animal </h4>

				<img src="images/hybridAnimal.jpg">
				<br>
				<p> This project was one of a series of projects for <i>Digital Imagery for Non-Majors</i>. The course focused mostly
					on Adobe Photoshop and it's functions. This project was the first and was meant to teach us proper
					selecting and positioning as well as color blending. We were tasked to choose two animals for our composition
					and I chose a wolf, because I admire them, as well as the squirrel, because my best friend hates them. With a
					well composed image, I have created the uncreatively named "Wolf-Squirrel".
				</p>

				<h4> Composition A </h4>

				<img id="compA" src="images/compA.jpg">
				<br>
				<p> The third of the series of projects used all of the skills we had gained to create a fantasy image. The assignment
					was to take multiple pictures of a landcape, merge those pictures together to make one large image, then add figures into the image.
					I love mythical creatures, so I tried to incorporate all of my favorites into this one image. I tried to make the composition make sense by adding the
					portal through which the creatures came from. This was my favorite project of the entire class.
				</p>

				<h4> Composition B </h4>

				<video id="compB" src="images/compB.mp4" controls></video>
				<br>
				<p> The fourth and final project gave us insight into a new software called Adobe After Affects. For this project, we were to use
					Composition A to create an animation. We could do anything we wanted as long as some of the subjects or objects moved in
					the animation. I decided to continue with the mythical theme, making minor changes to the source images to accommodate my new ideas.
					This video works best using Chrome.

				<h2>Website Building</h2>
				<p>This section features various websites that I have created from scratch. I101 was my first technology class
					and an introduction to web design and development. A110 was a similar course that went a bit more in depth.
					Finally, Web Design is the most recent site building class that I have taken that delves further into the
					process and fine details of designing a website from structure to graphic design to responsive design to usability testing.

					<h3> Web Design </h3>
					<h4> Project 1: Recipe Structure </h4>

					<a href="http://pages.iu.edu/~abaublet/Web_Design/Project1_Recipe/tiramisu-recipe.html" target="_blank">
									<img src="images/tiramisu-recipe.JPG"></a>
					<br>
					<p> For this project, the idea was to learn how to structure web content on a page only using html tags and elements.
						This task helped me understand how certain points of content should be layed out on a page and grouped closer together
						if they are related. The design aspects of this project were muted in an effort to focus on the first level of
						structuring.

					<h4> Project 2: Quote Design </h4>

					<img src="images/quote_design.JPG" id="quote"></a>
					<br>
					<p> This project focused more on design using typography, positioning, and colors in relation to an image that would
						appeal to the audience. The toughest part of this project was determining which part of the quote to emphasize
						and if that part truly represented the quote and image's focus.
